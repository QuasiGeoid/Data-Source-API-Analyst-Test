# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions to common issues encountered when using the API endpoints for **Search Repositories (public)**, **List Commits**, and **Get Repository Content**.

---

## 1. Search Repositories (public)

### Issue: API returns an empty result set
**Possible Causes:**  
- The search query does not match any repositories.  
- Filters (e.g., language, stars) are too restrictive.  

**Solutions:**  
1. Double-check the search query for typos or incorrect syntax.  
2. Remove or adjust filters to broaden the search.  
3. Verify that the API token has the required permissions for search.

---

### Issue: Slow response times
**Possible Causes:**  
- The query is too complex or includes multiple filters.  
- Server-side issues or network latency.  

**Solutions:**  
1. Simplify the query by removing unnecessary filters.  
2. Test during off-peak hours to identify server load issues.  
3. Ensure your client application handles pagination properly to avoid overloading the API.

## 2. List Commits

### Issue: Commits are not returned
**Possible Causes:**  
- The repository or branch name is incorrect.  
- The specified SHA does not exist in the repository.  

**Solutions:**  
1. Verify the repository and branch names.  
2. Ensure the SHA value is correct and matches the intended commit.  
3. Check that your API token has access to the repository.

---

### Issue: Missing file changes in the response
**Possible Cause:**  
- File changes were not requested in the API call.  

**Solution:**  
- Ensure the request includes the appropriate query parameter or scope to retrieve file changes.

---

## 3. Get Repository Content

### Issue: 404 error when accessing repository contents
**Possible Causes:**  
- The requested path does not exist.  
- The SHA or branch specified in the query is incorrect.  

**Solutions:**  
1. Verify the repository structure and confirm the existence of the path.  
2. Double-check the SHA or branch name used in the request.  
3. Confirm that the repository is public or your token has access to it.

---

### Issue: Schema validation failure
**Possible Cause:**  
- The response structure does not match the expected schema for files or directories.  

**Solutions:**  
1. Ensure that the path points to the correct type (file or directory).  
2. Check the API documentation for schema details and adjust validation logic if needed.

---

### Issue: Content type is incorrect or missing metadata
**Possible Causes:**  
- The file encoding or type is not properly set.  
- The requested file type is unsupported.  

**Solutions:**  
1. Inspect the file's metadata to ensure it is encoded correctly.  
2. Contact support if the file type is unsupported or results in incomplete metadata.

## General Issues

### Issue: Unauthorized access (401 error)
**Possible Causes:**  
- Invalid or expired access token.  
- Insufficient token permissions.  

**Solutions:**  
1. Regenerate the access token and ensure it has the necessary permissions.  
2. Verify that the token is correctly included in the `Authorization` header.  

---

### Issue: Malformed request (400 error)
**Possible Cause:**  
- Invalid parameters in the request.  

**Solutions:**  
1. Double-check the query parameters for typos or incorrect values.  
2. Refer to the API documentation for valid parameter options.  

---

### Issue: API throttling or rate-limiting
**Possible Cause:**  
- Too many requests sent in a short period.  

**Solutions:**  
1. Reduce the frequency of API calls.  
2. Implement exponential backoff in your application to retry requests.  
3. Monitor your API usage and optimize requests to avoid rate limits.
